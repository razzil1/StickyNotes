## About

This project is a part of my Bachelor Studies at Faculty of Mathematics. It is written in `Ruby`, using `ShoesRb` for user interface and `sqlite3` for manipulating database.

It allows you to save the notes and tasks that
you need to do. You can mark them as finished and delete them if you don't want them to be displayed.
